    <h1>Netherlands</h1>
    <h2>Davy Klaassen (Ajax)</h2>
    <p><b>The blonde-haired playmaker is viewed as the natural successor to Wesley Sneijder in the Dutch national team.</b>
      <br>Our man says: “Davy is a really talented midfielder with vision, great touch and an eye for goal.
      <br>“He has represented Holland twice, but some recent stomach problems mean he will miss their games in June. Davy has been linked with Barcelona and has the quality to play for them.“</p>
    <h2>Riechedly Bazoer (Ajax)</h2>
    <p><b>Bazoer has been dubbed the new Patrick Vieira - even by the man himself. Manchester City have tried to sign him and were thwarted - for the time being, at least</b>
      <br>Our man says: “Riechedly has had a lot of opportunities to go abroad and City were really interested in him.
      <br>“Not only does he look like Patrick Vieira, he plays like him too. He is one of the biggest talents in Holland, there’s no doubt about that.
      <br>“In two or three years, he will be in the Premier League or with one of the big Spanish sides, and he will become a big star. I just hope he stays in Holland to play more games and develop further.”</p>
    <h2>Jetro Willems (PSV)</h2>
    <p><b>A flying full-back who has already won 15 caps for the Dutch national side, attracting rave reviews.</b>
      <br>“Early on in his career, Jetro had some problems with his discipline and off-field behaviour,” says our expert.
      <br>“Then he saw the light and realised what it takes to be a top professional footballer. Since then, he hasn’t looked back.
      <br>“He got the most assists of any player for PSV this season, which is phenomenal for a full-back. He is fast, athletic and a brilliant passer.</p>
    <h2>Georginio Wijnaldum (PSV)</h2>
    <p><b>A skilful winger with an unpronouncable name. Already 24, but linked with a big-money move to United this summer, where he could join up with compatriot Depay.</b>
      <br>“Louis Van Gaal likes Georginio very much and took him to the 2014 World Cup,” our man says.
      <br>“Although he didn’t get many chances in Brazil, he did score against the hosts in the third/ fourth place play-off.
      <br>“He can play centrally or out on the right side and, in my opinion, is one of the most dynamic midfielders in the whole of Europe. Speed, balance, dribbling ability - he has it all and is a very exciting player.”</p>
    <h2>Memphis Depay (PSV)</h2>
    <p><b>Our expert says: “I think Memphis can become a real star at United, although it will take some time for him to adapt to the Premier League.</b>
      <br>“He has special quality. His shooting is amazing, as you have seen from some of the free kicks he’s scored for PSV, and he is fast and direct. With LVG in the hotseat, he has just the right man there to develop his potential.”</p>

<h1>Italy</h1><h2>Mateo Kovacic (Inter Milan)</h2><p><b>INTER have tied down the Croatia playmaker, 21, until 2019 so they are under no pressure to sell him on the cheap.</b><br>Liverpool have been regularly sending scouts to watch Kovacic, while Manchester United have also shown strong interest.<br>And our informer reckons the highly-rated 19-cap international will be available — at a price.<br>He said: “Kovacic is a very talented midfielder but he hasn’t found a position under Mancini so Inter could decide to cash in if a bid of over £21million comes in.”</p><h2>Mauro Icardi (Inter Milan)</h2><p><b>CHELSEA target Icardi has bagged an impressive 19 league goals this season and has also caught the eye of Juventus.</b><br>But the Blues’ hopes took a hit when the Argentine striker, who came through Sampdoria’s youth ranks, singed a four-year deal worth £2.5m a year.<br>And our man thinks it is unlikely Icardi, 22, will be allowed to leave, insisting: “If one of the biggest clubs in England show interest something could happen.<br>“But Roberto Mancini likes him very much. I’m 99 per cent sure he will be at Inter next season but not 100 per cent so there is some hope.”</p><h2>Mattia Perin (Genoa)</h2><p><b>THE Italy stopper, 22, played a significant role in his club’s impressive season, conceding just 36 goals in 31 matches, and has caught the eye of Arsene Wenger.</b><br>Genoa currently sit sixth in the table but have been banned from competing in the Europa League as the ground they share with Sampdoria isn’t up to scratch.<br>Our insider said: “Perin is a great talent who has already earned himself an international cap and could be the man to replace Buffon.<br>“He is under contract until 2019 but Genoa are in financial trouble and a bid of £10.5m could make them sell.”</p><h2>Matteo Darmian (Torino)</h2><p><b>AC MILAN product Darmian established himself as on of the league’s top full-backs at Torino — earning himself a World Cup call-up.</b><br>He played in all three of the Azzurri’s games as they crashed out in the group stage.<br>The 25-year-old — voted the national team’s player of the year for 2014 by fans — has been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal.<br>“Darmian is a very good player,” says our scout.<br>“Carlo Ancelotti has said he would be a good signing for Real Madrid and a bid of £11-13m could be enough to sign him.”</p><h2>Paul Pogba (Juventus)</h2><p><b>THE French powerhouse could play for any team in Europe and is on the radar of all the continent’s top clubs.</b><br>Manchester United would be particularly keen to bring the 22-year-old back to Old Trafford after foolishly letting him through their grasp.<br>But our man reckons rivals City would be in pole position to pull off a coup due to Juve’s valuation of their star midfielder.<br>He said: “Juventus do not want to lose Pogba but a bid of £64-71m may force them to cash in.”</p><h2>Domenico Berrardi (Sassuolo/ Juventus)</h2><p><b>ITALIAN whizkid has scored 14 goals for Sassuolo so far this season taking his tally to an impressive 41 career league goals at just 20 years of age.</b><br>Berardi is co-owned by champions Juve, who allowed the youngster to return to Sassuolo, where he has played since 2010.<br>He has represented his country at Under-21 level but is yet to feature for the national side. Tottenham are reportedly very keen on the striker, while Chelsea, City and United have also been linked.<br>Our insider said: “Berrardi is one of the best young players in Italy but he will be difficult to sign. Juventus will decide his future.”</p>
