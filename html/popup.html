    <h1>Netherlands</h1>
    <h2>Davy Klaassen (Ajax)</h2>
    <p><b>The blonde-haired playmaker is viewed as the natural successor to Wesley Sneijder in the Dutch national team.</b>
      <br>Our man says: “Davy is a really talented midfielder with vision, great touch and an eye for goal.
      <br>“He has represented Holland twice, but some recent stomach problems mean he will miss their games in June. Davy has been linked with Barcelona and has the quality to play for them.“</p>
    <h2>Riechedly Bazoer (Ajax)</h2>
    <p><b>Bazoer has been dubbed the new Patrick Vieira - even by the man himself. Manchester City have tried to sign him and were thwarted - for the time being, at least</b>
      <br>Our man says: “Riechedly has had a lot of opportunities to go abroad and City were really interested in him.
      <br>“Not only does he look like Patrick Vieira, he plays like him too. He is one of the biggest talents in Holland, there’s no doubt about that.
      <br>“In two or three years, he will be in the Premier League or with one of the big Spanish sides, and he will become a big star. I just hope he stays in Holland to play more games and develop further.”</p>
    <h2>Jetro Willems (PSV)</h2>
    <p><b>A flying full-back who has already won 15 caps for the Dutch national side, attracting rave reviews.</b>
      <br>“Early on in his career, Jetro had some problems with his discipline and off-field behaviour,” says our expert.
      <br>“Then he saw the light and realised what it takes to be a top professional footballer. Since then, he hasn’t looked back.
      <br>“He got the most assists of any player for PSV this season, which is phenomenal for a full-back. He is fast, athletic and a brilliant passer.</p>
    <h2>Georginio Wijnaldum (PSV)</h2>
    <p><b>A skilful winger with an unpronouncable name. Already 24, but linked with a big-money move to United this summer, where he could join up with compatriot Depay.</b>
      <br>“Louis Van Gaal likes Georginio very much and took him to the 2014 World Cup,” our man says.
      <br>“Although he didn’t get many chances in Brazil, he did score against the hosts in the third/ fourth place play-off.
      <br>“He can play centrally or out on the right side and, in my opinion, is one of the most dynamic midfielders in the whole of Europe. Speed, balance, dribbling ability - he has it all and is a very exciting player.”</p>
    <h2>Memphis Depay (PSV)</h2>
    <p><b>Our expert says: “I think Memphis can become a real star at United, although it will take some time for him to adapt to the Premier League.</b>
      <br>“He has special quality. His shooting is amazing, as you have seen from some of the free kicks he’s scored for PSV, and he is fast and direct. With LVG in the hotseat, he has just the right man there to develop his potential.”</p>
